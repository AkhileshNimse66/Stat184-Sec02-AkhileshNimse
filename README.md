Introduction
This repository focuses on analyzing baby name trends in the United States using the BabyNames dataset. The goal of this project was to explore the popularity of selected names over time, apply data wrangling techniques, and create a compelling visualization to reveal trends in naming patterns. Data was filtered and analyzed to normalize name popularity relative to total births for a more accurate representation.

Implementation
Filtering the dataset to focus on three selected names: Emma, Liam, and Sophia.
Normalizing name popularity by dividing yearly counts by total births for each year to understand relative popularity trends.
Using R's dplyr package for data wrangling and ggplot2 for creating visualizations.
Addressing challenges such as:
Missing values in certain years and ensuring accurate grouping.
Enhancing the plot readability through custom themes and color adjustments.

Results or Conclusion
The visualization highlighted significant trends:

Emma maintained consistent popularity, peaking in recent years for girls.
Liam showed rapid growth starting in the early 2000s, becoming a top name for boys.
Sophia experienced a surge in the late 1990s and has remained a favorite for girls.
